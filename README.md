# Subject resources

This is a rolling-release collection of my notes and programming journeys that I think the students in my school can make good use of. Particularly the ~3600 Spanish flash cards.

## Flash cards

*hello world*

**hello world**

***hello world***

Cards are stored in `cards/`.

Find the Quizlet forms of my cards [here!](https://quizlet.com/Eingabeaufforderung/folders)

For my own version of quizlet write, check out [quizlet-write](https://github.com/RubberDuckCollector/quizlet-write)

### Languages

- my flash card sets are more usable than the ones in the textbook.
    - e.g in spanish, the masculine + feminine forms of each adjective are in my cards in a much more explicit format compared to the textbook
    - the male + female versions of nouns like *jefe* and *jefa* are much more explicit in my flash cards than the textbooks'
    - this makes it easier to recall feminine versions of words so they are given equal significance in the flash card set, which is not the case in the textbooks

#### Dutch

- Flash cards:
    - Cannot find any active GCSE or A level courses on Dutch in the UK. The closest I can find is an old OCR course however I haven't found any textbooks and the course was discontinued just before the switch from A*-U to 9-1.
        - Tell me instantly if you find a Dutch textbook from the UK. I know that UCL has a Dutch course and I've already applied to it.
    - Have fun with a sparratic mix of topics
    - Dutch flash cards have plurals for all nouns because it's a bit confusing

#### Spanish

- Will be responding to all AQA AS speaking cards

    - (markdown rewrite coming someday?)
- i will still make them available here regardless. just don't want to use any proprietary standards
