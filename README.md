## Languages

### Dutch
- Flash cards:
    - Cannot find any courses on Dutch in the UK. The closest I can find is an old OCR course however I haven't found any textbooks and the course was discontinued just before the switch from A-U to 9-1.
        - Tell me instantly if you find a Dutch textbook from the UK. I know that UCL has a Dutch course and I've already applied to it.
    - Have fun with a sparratic mix of topics
    - Dutch flash cards have plurals for all nouns because it's a bit confusing

# Notes

- to be added soon! planned dir is `vaults/`

# To do

- don't know if structure should be by `department/subject` instead of `cards/department` and `notes/department`, where they're separate
- example of proposed structure:
    - `stem/cs/notes`
    - `stem/cs/cards/unit1`
    - `stem/cs/cards/unit2`
