For A Level: check out my [recursive binary search solution](search/binary/recursive-binary.py)

- i have python here but i'm also planning to expand to some examples for compiled languages, namely C and Rust
- to show that the logic is the same, the only differences in these algorithms will be idiomatic and use special techniques of a language. 
    - i.e the underlying theory will always be the same
