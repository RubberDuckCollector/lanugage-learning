## Computers in the workplace

- the influence of comptuers in the workplace fluctuates depending on the environment
    - it's lower in environments such as offices where people would still work
    - but in factories computers have automated nearly every part of the fabrication process
    - where lower skill jobs can now be automates
        - therefore employers in a factory would typically only look for highly skilled people instead of people with not many skills, because a computer has already replaced them

Example: introducing a banking app to automate processes

### impact on customers

#### positives

- they have access to the bank at all times through an internet connected device
    - don't have to travel to the bank (therefore saves time)

#### negatives

- less personal experience (so people may have a less satisfactory experience)
- with the app, there is a new opportunity for hacking and cyber attacks by hackers

### impact on bank staff

#### positive

- new job roles will be produced as a result of automating things
    - e.g computer and server maintainance roles will appear to accommodate the extra server usage by the app users

#### negatives

- employess will be laid off due to the closure of branches
    - **because less people would go to the bank, so they'd do less work and thus be less financially viable/useful**

### impact on banks

- less financial and admin overhead (saving money by firing people)
