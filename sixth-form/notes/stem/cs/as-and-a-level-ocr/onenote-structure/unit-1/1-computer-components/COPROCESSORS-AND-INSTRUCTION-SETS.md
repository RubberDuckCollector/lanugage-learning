## Coprocessor

A coprocessor is an additional microprocessor that aids a bigger processor in its functions and capabilities
- e.g: some processors may have an **extra circuit** in them which is **specifically designed** to calculate division operations or square root operations

## Instruction sets

**An instruction set is a collection of commands that a processor can understand and act on.**
    - LMC example: (MAKE LMC NOTES)
    `STA` would be in the instruction set of an LMC CPU.
