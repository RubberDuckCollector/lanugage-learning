## clock speed

- measured from the [system clock](./PROCESSOR-COMPONENTS.md)
- the clock speed corresponds to the number of FDE cycles per second
- the faster the clock speed, the faster the CPU
    - however this produces more heat in the CPU due to the resistance of the wires in the CPU
    - where there are more electrons flowing through them and collide more with the metal ions in the wire which transfers their kinetic energy into heat energy
        - therefore **a better cooling system is required for a CPU with a higher clock speed** 

## overclocking

- the act of increasing the number of cycles per second in the CPU by:
    - increasing the amount of energy the CPU receives
    - removing restrictions the CPU may have
