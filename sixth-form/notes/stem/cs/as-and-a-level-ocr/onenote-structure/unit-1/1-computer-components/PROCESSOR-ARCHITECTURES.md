- a processor can ***only*** **fetch** instructions, **decode** instructions, and **execute** instructions.

## Types of architectures

1. Von Neumann architecture
    - there are 3 buses:
        1. data bus
        2. [control bus](./PROCESSOR-COMPONENTS.md#control-bus)
        3. address bus
    - the instructions and data of the CPU are stored in the same space in memory
