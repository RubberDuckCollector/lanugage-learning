# computer science

i want to painstakingly copy my notes over to markdown because i don't want to lose them when i lose access to onenote for school

# onenote structure/spec structure

- onenote is laid out in the same way i did the course through onenote where my teachers put up the worksheets
- it's ordered slightly differently but the topics are more readable and the structure is more relaxed
    - is primarily there because it's easier for me that way and for the people from my school (potentially) reading this. Hello!
