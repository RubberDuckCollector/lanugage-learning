# Rust

**2024-03-24**

## Why I'm doing this

I want to learn rust because you cannot write unsafe code (without knowing) by design and it goes really fast unlike python.
- also because those lower level skills will probably be useful one day
    - have fun reading through my code and suffering
    - rust is hard but not bs (like some other javascripts that need no introduction)
