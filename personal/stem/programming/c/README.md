# C

I want to learn C because it goes really fast and its simplicity makes me interested

I want to explore what it's like to program even lower down than Rust

I'm going to have a dir for each new thing I do in C. Each thing will have a `bin/` directory which I'm going to ignore in .gitignore because you don't need to see the binary and neither does github.
